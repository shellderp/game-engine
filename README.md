# game-engine

This is a WIP game engine I'm creating as I work on a game project.

What's inside:
- shellderp.game.network: A reliable UDP implementation that allows unreliable sends. Designed for frequent low-latency updates (eg. physics). Good entry points are Connection and Server.

Eventually this will include:

- UI components
- state management
- data file auto updating
- sound effects
