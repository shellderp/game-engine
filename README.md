# game-engine

This is the game engine I'm creating as I work on my latest game project.

What's inside:
- shellderp.game.network: A network library on top of UDP with optional reliable transport. This is built specifically for frequent low-latency location updates. Good entry points are Connection and Server.

Eventually this will include UI components, state management, data file auto updating, sound effects.
